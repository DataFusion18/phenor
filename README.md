# phenor

The phenor R package is a phenology modelling framework in R.

The package is curently focusses on North America and Europe and relies heavily on [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) and [E-OBS climate data](http://www.ecad.eu/download/ensembles/download.php) for model optimization.

The package supports global CMIP5 forecasts for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios using the [NASA Earth Exchange global downscaled daily projections](https://nex.nasa.gov/nex/projects/1356/).

Phenological model validation data are derived from:

- PhenoCam time series through the [phenocamr](https://github.com/khufkens/phenocamr) R package
- the MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology product using the [MODISTools R package](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1273/full)
- the [Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725)](http://www.pep725.eu/) 

We refer to Hufkens et al. (2017, see below) for an in depth description and worked example of the phenor R package. All code used to generate the referenced publication is provided in the analysis folder of this repository. Keep in mind that some of the scripts will take a significant amount of time to finish. As such, some data generated for the manuscript is included in the R package. Some scripts to generate model comparison figures and summary statistics on precompiled datasets rather than clean runs. Furthermore, due to licensing issues no PEP725 data is included and some scripts will require proper login credentials for dependent code to function.

## Installation

To install the toolbox in R run the following commands in a R terminal

```R
if(!require(devtools)){install.package(devtools)}
devtools::install_github("khufkens/phenor")
library(phenor)
```
Additional PhenoCam data (Richarson et al. 2017) can be downloaded as:

```
git clone https://github.com/khufkens/phenocam_dataset.git
```

or from the ORNL DAAC archive as described in the paper.

## Use

Example code below shows that in few lines a modelling exercise can be set up. You can either download your own data using the phenocamr pacakge and format them correctly using **format_phenocam()**

```R
# The command below downloads all time series for deciduous broadleaf
# data at the bartlett PhenoCam site and estimates the
# phenophases.
download_phenocam(vegetation = "DB",
                  site = "bartlett",
                  phenophase = TRUE)

# process phenocam transition files into a consistent format
phenocam_data = format_phenocam("/foo/bar/transition_dates/")
```

Alternatively you can use the included data which consists of 370 site years of deciduous broadleaf forest sites as included in PhenoCam 1.0 dataset (Richardson et al. 2017) precompiled with Daymet climate variables. The file is loaded using a standard **data()** call or reference them directly (e.g. *phenocam_DB*).

```R
# load the included data using
data("phenocam_DB")
```

### Model development, and parameter estimation

The gathered data can now be used in model validation. Currently 17 models as described by Basler (2016) are provided in the pacakge. These models include: null, LIN, TT, TTs, PTT, PTTs, M1, M1s, PA, Pab, SM1, SM1b, SQ, SQb, UN, UM1, PM1 and PM1b models as described in Basler (2016). In addition three spring grassland phenology models: GR, SGSI and AGSI are included as described in Garcia-Mozo et al. 2009 and Xin et al. 2015. Finally, one autumn chilling degree day model (CDD, Jeong et al. 2012) is provided. Parameter values associated with the models are provided in a separate file included in the package.

```R
# comma separated parameter file inlcuded in the package
# for all the included models, this file is used by default
# in all optimization routines
path = sprintf("%s/extdata/parameter_ranges.csv",path.package("phenor"))
par_ranges = read.table(path,
                        header = TRUE,
                        sep = ",")
```

Your own model development can be done by creating similar functions which take in the described data format and parameters. Below is the function to optimize the model parameters for the *TT* (thermal time) model using Generalized Simulated Annealing (GenSA). Uppper and lower constraints to the parameter space have to be provided, and in case of GenSA initial parameters are estimated when par = NULL.

```R
# optimize model parameters
set.seed(1234)
optim.par = optimize_parameters(par = NULL,
                          data = phenocam_data,
                          cost = rmse,
                          model = "TT",
                          method = "GenSA",
                          lower = c(1,-5,0),
                          upper = c(365,10,2000))
```

After a few minutes optimal parameters are provided. We can use these now to calculate our model values and some accuracy metrics.

```R
# now run the model for all data in the nested list using the estimated parameters
modelled = estimate_phenology(data = data,
                              par = optim.par$par)
```

Easy model validation can be achieved using the **model_validation()** and **model_comparison()** functions. Which either allow for quick screening for model development, or the comparison of a suite of models (using different starting parameters). I hope this gets you started.
