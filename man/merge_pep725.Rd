\title{Preprocessing of PEP725 data, merges separate files into tidy
data, with each observation a line, each column a different
parameter value.}
\usage{
merge_pep725(path = "~")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{a path to the PEP725 data (species files only)}
}
\value{
concatted data of all data in the path as a tidy data frame
including all normal parameters, and the species name and country code
as derived from the file name
}
\description{
Mind that the PEP725 database is badly managed. For example the Irish
station file includes site description with semi-colons in the description
of a semi-colon delimited file format. This will crash the routine. I will
not provide a bug fix for these known issues with the underlying
PEP725 database due to mismanagement on their part.
